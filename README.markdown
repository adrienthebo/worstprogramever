The worst program ever
======================

This program counts from 1 to n without loops or conditionals. In the worst
way possible.

Compiling
---------

Run `make` in the current directory.

Running
-------

Run `./fail <n>` in the current directory. Make sure you pass it a number, or
it will segfault.

I would like to see you do input validation without loops or conditionals.

Do not use a very large n, or you'll OOM your box.

Apologies
---------

This is a bad thing, and I feel bad for making it.
